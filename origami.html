    <img src = "camel.png" width = 200 height = 200></a>
    <h3>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.

        Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.

        Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.

        Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.

        Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.
        
        Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!

        When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.

        Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.

        Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!

        Don’t make a camel angry – they can spit as a way to distract whatever they think is a threat</h3>
